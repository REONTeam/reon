  region-explanation-para1: REON enables international trade for Pokémon Crystal players, via the in-game facility called the Trade Corner. This includes trading between Japanese and non-Japanese games, which are normally incompatible due to using different character sets. To make such trades possible, the service changes Pokémon nicknames, Trainer names, and messages written on Mail when matching Pokémon between Japanese and non-Japanese games (for example, changing "A" to "ア", and vice-versa). These changes are irreversible, but they aim to imitate the original language's lettering as faithfully as possible.
  region-explanation-para2: Choose the pool of regions you're okay with trading with. This setting can be changed after sign-up as well.
